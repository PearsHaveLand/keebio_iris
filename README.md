#### Firmware for my Keebio Iris keyboard

### About

This is a [Keebio Iris Rev4 keybaord](https://keeb.io/collections/iris-split-ergonomic-keyboard/products/iris-keyboard-pre-built). I built it because mechanical keyboards sound nice, I wanted to try something more ergonomic, and I thought it'd be fun. It uses the [QMK Library](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/) for most of the backend, while I adapted the layout for my own liking.

Since building it, I've found I prefer a simpler layout. So I do not make use of any extra functionalities like tap-dancing or RGB lighting changes.
